Þórr did not come, because he was on the east-way. Sif, Þórr’s wife, was there, and Bragi and Iðunn, his wife. Týr was there. He was one-handed: Fenrisúlfr bit off his hand when he was bound. Njǫrðr was there, as was his wife, Skaði, Freyr and Freyja, [and] Víðarr, Óðinn’s son. Loki was there, and Freyr’s servants, Byggvir and Beyla. Many of the Æsir and elves were there.\n\nÆgir had two serving-men, Fimafengr and Eldir. Shining gold was used there instead of firelight. Ale served itself there. It was a great place of sanctuary. People were full of praise for how good Ægir’s serving-men were. Loki could not bear to hear that, and he slew Fimafengr.\n\nThen the Æsir shook their shields and screamed at Loki, and chased him away to the forest, and they went to drink. Loki turned back and met Eldir outside.",

He finds the grave of a dead seeress (völva) and resurrects her with magic. In disguise, Odin questions her and learns that the halls of Hel are being prepared for Baldr. The seeress reveals Baldr will be killed by his blind brother, Hǫðr. She then prophesies that Váli will be born to avenge Baldur's death. After the seeress recognizes him, Odin returns to Asgard with the grim knowledge of his son's fate.",

The questions cover the parentage of giants, the names of primordial beings, and the fates of the gods during Ragnarök. Both Odin and the giant answer every question correctly, proving to be intellectual equals. For the final question, Odin asks something only he could possibly know: \"What did Odin whisper in Baldr's ear on his funeral pyre?\" Recognizing his opponent's true identity, Vafþrúðnir concedes defeat, acknowledging that Odin is the wisest of all beings."

Believing him to be a dangerous sorcerer, the cruel king captures Odin (as \"Grímnir\") and tortures him between two fires. After the king's young son shows him kindness by offering a drink, Odin begins a long, prophetic monologue. He reveals a vast wealth of mythological knowledge as a reward for the boy's compassion. He describes the heavenly halls of the gods, the layout of Valhalla, and the structure of the world tree, Yggdrasil. Near the end of his speech, he lists his many names and reveals his true identity as Odin. Horrified at having tortured the chief god, King Geirröðr rushes forward but trips and impales himself on his own sword. His kind son, who helped Odin, then inherits the throne and rules as the new king."

Thor returns home to find that Alvíss has come to claim Thor's daughter, Þrúðr, as his bride, an arrangement made in Thor's absence. Thor declares the dwarf can only win his bride by answering a series of questions about the names for Earth, Sky, Moon, Sun, clouds, wind, fire, and other entities as they are known among the different races (men, Æsir, Vanir, giants, elves, and dwarfs). Thor deliberately prolongs the questioning until sunrise. As a dwarf, Alvíss is turned to stone by the daylight."
